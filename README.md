# chisel-primer

This is a first attempt to have a standalone directory with scala/chisel code that works. The project setup is entirelly based on ucb-bar chisel-tutorial https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-tutorial, and the Mux2 code is copied from there. Other files have been adapted, while the LFSR.scala is a 6bit (and 3subbit) personal implementation.
